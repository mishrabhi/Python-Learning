                While nowadays every festival is taking the form of modernism, similarly Diwali has adopted the present
                form. Where earlier on the occasion of Deepawali, people used to decorate their houses with earthen
                lamps.

                Today, candles and Chinese lights have replaced those lamps. Not only this, but Deepawali has also
                become a festival of showings of “Shan-o-Shaukat” in today’s time.

                People spend a lot of time on show-off to each other, by the decorating of the house, etc. Apart from
                this, fireworks on the occasion of Diwali cause great harm to the environment, there is also a waste of
                money.

                Pollution increases greatly on Diwali, which has a very bad effect on health. At the same time, all of
                us should resolve to plant new trees instead of firecrackers and celebrate green eco-friendly Diwali.
