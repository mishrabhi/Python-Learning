            Diwali (Deepavali or Divali) is a festival of lights and one of the major festivals celebrated
             by Hindus, Jains and Sikhs.The festival usually lasts five days and is celebrated during
              the Hindu lunisolar month Kartika (between mid-October and mid-November).One of the most
             popular festivals of Hinduism, Diwali symbolizes the spiritual "victory of light over 
             darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance".The festival is widely associated 
             with Lakshmi, goddess of prosperity, with many other regional traditions connecting the holiday 
             to Sita and Rama, Vishnu, Krishna, Yama, Yami, Durga, Kali, Hanuman, Ganesha, Kubera, 
             Dhanvantari, or Vishvakarman. Furthermore, it is, in some regions, a celebration of the day 
             Lord Rama returned to his kingdom Ayodhya with his wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana after 
             defeating Ravana in Lanka and serving 14 years of exile.<br>
             In the lead-up to Diwali, celebrants will prepare by cleaning, renovating, and 
             decorating their homes and workplaces with diyas (oil lamps) and rangolis.During
             Diwali, people wear their finest clothes, illuminate the interior and exterior of their 
             homes with diyas and rangoli, perform worship ceremonies of Lakshmi, the goddess of 
             prosperity and wealth,[note 1] light fireworks, and partake in family feasts, where mithai 
             (sweets) and gifts are shared. Diwali is also a major cultural event for the Hindu and Jain 
             diaspora from the Indian subcontinent.

        <p class="para">
            The Diwali festival is likely a fusion of harvest festivals in ancient India.It is
            mentioned in Sanskrit texts such as the Padma Purana and the Skanda Purana both of which 
            were completed in the second half of the 1st millennium CE. The diyas (lamps) are mentioned 
            in Skanda Kishore Purana as symbolising parts of the sun, describing it as the cosmic giver 
            of light and energy to all life and which seasonally transitions in the Hindu calendar 
            month of Kartik.<br>
            Diwali was also described by numerous travellers from outside India. In his 11th century 
            memoir on India, the Persian traveller and historian Al Biruni wrote of Deepavali being 
            celebrated by Hindus on the day of the New Moon in the month of Kartika.
